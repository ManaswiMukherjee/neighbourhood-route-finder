<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
Commuters and local service drivers need a fast, reliable way to find practical routes through neighbourhood streets using public-transport-accessible roads. Existing map tools focus on cars, long-distance transit, or walking routes and often don’t reflect constraints important to small public-transport vehicles (e.g., mini-buses, shuttles, or ADA-accessible routes). This makes planning short, frequent, local trips inefficient, error-prone, or inaccessible for operators and passengers.

\
This neighbourhood route finder is a terminal application that computes optimal, safe, and policy-compliant routes for public-transport vehicles within a local area. It takes into account road restrictions and schedule constraints, and outputs clear, minimal-turn routes and stops usable by drivers and dispatchers in low-bandwidth or command-line environments.
